ABL Core
==========================

Abstract
--------------
This is an implementation of some core classes that would be 'nice to have' in object-oriented OpenEdge ABL (coming from a Java background).  A lot of the implementation details will be planned to come from the OpenJDK source, when possible, in order to make the two as symmetrical as possible (where plausible, of course).

Status
--------------
This is pre-alpha stage software; it is entirely work-in-progress.  Getting involved will require getting your hands dirty!

How to use it
--------------
* Add the `com/abevoelker` path to your `PROPATH`.
